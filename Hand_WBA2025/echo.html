        <p style="text-align: center; color: #bf4315">This is Gus, my 3 year old cat, the sweetest 
        cat in the whole world. This is him portraying the distortion of sight, as there are only 3 of 
        him, but it seems as if he is infinite. He is the embodiment of a little boy with a propeller 
        hat and a huge lollipop. In this animation, I've embodied the silly and sleepy nature of my 
        cat. He loops forever, just like in real life! The pixelated nature of this gif 
        reflects that he would make a great video game cat companion, as he is <b>perfect.</b>
