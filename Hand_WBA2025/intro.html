        <p style="text-align: center; color: rgb(75, 69, 140)">This started as truly a daunting task, 
        as my only coding experience was using Scratch in the middle school computer lab. These 
        programs seem harder to master than a foreign language for me, <i>and yet I persist</i>.
        After wallowing in sorrow for far too long, I remebered I love a challenge and this would pose
        quite a large one for me. With that in mind, enjoy my very first webpage and actual coding project!
        <i>This was actually fun when I finally understood what I was doing...</i> </p>
