        <p style="text-align: center; color: #00861e">For this piece, I took my first image from the "Bad 
        Photoshop" and ran it through a glitch generator, producing the image you see 
        now! I already experiemented with distortion while creating the original image. 
        I did this by copying and pasting components from the lego bouquet to create a 
        larger bouquet. After doing this, I copied and pasted the bouquet on top of 
        itself 2 times, and had them to the left and right of the center bouquet. Then,
        I put lego flowers in the background of the image to create balance. I like that the added
        distortion brings an entirely different viewing context for the piece.</p>
